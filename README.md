# Automated Attendance Tracking System

## Project Overview
This project is an automated attendance tracking system that leverages machine learning techniques for face detection. The system is designed to streamline the attendance process by accurately and efficiently identifying individuals using facial recognition.

## Key Features
- **Face Detection:** Utilizes OpenCV and TensorFlow to design and implement a robust face detection model.
- **Automated Attendance:** Automatically records attendance based on facial recognition, eliminating the need for manual entry.
- **Efficient Identification:** Ensures accurate identification of individuals to improve the overall reliability of attendance tracking.

## Technologies Used
- **OpenCV:** For image processing and face detection.
- **TensorFlow:** To develop the machine learning model for facial recognition.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/automated-attendance-system.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd automated-attendance-system
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. To start the system, run the following command:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
2. The system will automatically detect faces and record attendance based on the recognized individuals.
